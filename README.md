# 2020code5970
This is code uses a command-based framework to manage controls of subsystems on the robot from the 2020 Infinite Recharge season. It is primarily written in Python 3.7 and includes many unit tests under the testing directory. It frequently uses the robotpy library to interface with the RoboRIO and other mechanisms like motor controllers.

so it looked like lollyi instead. He did about half the pushes. 
(also because his brain is smooth)
